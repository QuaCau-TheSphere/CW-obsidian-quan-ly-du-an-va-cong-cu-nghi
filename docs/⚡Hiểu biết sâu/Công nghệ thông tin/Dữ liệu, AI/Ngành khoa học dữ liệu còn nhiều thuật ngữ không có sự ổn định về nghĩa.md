Khái niệm:: [Dữ liệu](../../%CE%9E%20Kh%C3%A1i%20ni%E1%BB%87m/D%E1%BB%AF%20li%E1%BB%87u.md)

look at what [information extraction covers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_extraction): it's very broad and vague, it goes from keyword extraction (but then, what is a keyword?) to extracting sophisticated semantic relations, and there can be many ways to represent semantic information. Additionally to the fact that data science is very recent compared to maths or physics, some of its concepts are philosophical concepts that philosophy itself doesn't define precisely. The blurry nature of concepts such as information, language, or even logic is the cause.
