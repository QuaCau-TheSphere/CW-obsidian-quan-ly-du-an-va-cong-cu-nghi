Khái niệm:: 
Engineers of automated systems are always navigating a tension between variety and constraint. Users want variety: when autonomous systems are more lively and unpredictable, they can also be more engaging. Early systems lacked strong constraints in favor of this variety, giving them more flavor — for better or for worse. That “flavor” led to chatbots that urged [journalists to leave their wives](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html), amidst a long history of generating violent or hateful rhetoric. Constraint, on the other hand, is intended to limit unpredictability. A model trained exclusively on Papal legal documents (magistereum.ai) is less likely to create unpredictable content than a purely open model trained on Reddit and 4chan posts. As models are refined, their variety is reduced, leading many users to grow bored with them, or imagine that they are [getting worse](https://gizmodo.com/study-finds-chatgpt-capabilities-are-getting-worse-1850655728).
