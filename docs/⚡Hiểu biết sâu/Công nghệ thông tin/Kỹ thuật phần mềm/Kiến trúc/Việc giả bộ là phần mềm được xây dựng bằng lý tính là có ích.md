1) Designers need guidance. When we undertake a large project we can easily be overwhelmed by the enormity of the task. We will be unsure about what to do first. A good understanding of the ideal process will help us to know how to proceed.
2) We will come closer to a rational design if we try to follow the process rather than proceed on an ad hoc basis. For example, even if we cannot know all of the facts necessary to design an ideal system, the effort to find those facts before we start to code will help us to design better and backtrack less.
3) When an organization undertakes many software projects, there are advantages to having a standard procedure. It makes it easier to have good design reviews, to transfer people, ideas, and software from one project to another. If we are going to specify a standard process, it seems reasonable that it should be a rational one.
4) If we have agreed on an ideal process, it becomes much easier to measure the progress that a project is making. We can compare the project's achievements to those that the ideal process calls for. We can identify areas in which we are behind (or ahead).
5) Regular review of the project's progress by outsiders is essential to good management. If the project is attempting to follow a standard process, it will be easier to review.
