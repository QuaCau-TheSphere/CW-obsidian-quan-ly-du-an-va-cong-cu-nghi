Khái niệm:: 
As a result, commercial interests, not public ones, will shape how they are trained and how they are instructed to answer queries. If we treat LLMs as trusted sources of information in the same way that the Wikipedia is, we become vulnerable to the whims of a small number of powerful actors with interests in pushing fringe narratives. The ["white genocide" meltdown](https://www.wired.com/story/grok-white-genocide-elon-musk/) of the Grok LLM offers a striking and frightening example. And if LLMs are trained indiscriminately on text from the internet, we also become vulnerable to "[LLM grooming](https://thebulletin.org/2025/03/russian-networks-flood-the-internet-with-propaganda-aiming-to-corrupt-ai-chatbots/)" campaigns of the sort already underway: disinformation efforts that aim to flood the training data for future LLMs with specific falsehoods.
