Okay, now, my fave resources on Game Design:

- [Game Maker's Tool Kit](https://www.youtube.com/c/MarkBrownGMT/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) (YouTube channel) (start with [Valve's Invisible Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMggqenxuZc))
- [Extra Credits: Making Your First Game](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhyKYa0YJ_5C6QC36h5eApOyXtx98ehGi) (YouTube series)
- [A Game Design Vocabulary](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780321886927) (book) ([free sample](https://w.itch.io/level-design-lessons))
- [The Art of Game Design](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780123694966) (textbook)

To start making games _without_ knowing how to code – or even buying or downloading anything yet! – check out these tools:

- [Twine](https://twinery.org/2/#!/welcome), for Choose Your Own Adventure-likes
- [Bitsy](https://bitsy.org/), for top-down exploration games (think Undertale)
- [PuzzleScript](https://www.puzzlescript.net/), for Sokoban-like puzzle games

For practice making SMALL-SCOPED games, check out itch·io's [list of game jams](https://itch.io/jams)!
