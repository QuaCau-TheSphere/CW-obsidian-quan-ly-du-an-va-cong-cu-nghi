Any technology starts with the idea that our relationship with the world could or should be something different. This idea is fundamental to human existence. At its essence, it’s a process of reflection. Throughout time, communities have reflected, and come up with all kinds of imaginative proposals for what could be. This process has, in turn, led people to seek out ways to take action and experiment — whether that means inventing something new, or adapting something from the past, or altering something that currently exists. Innovation has historically been a slow, patient process.
