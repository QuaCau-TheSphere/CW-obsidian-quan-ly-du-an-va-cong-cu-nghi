Khái niệm:: [Quy mô](../../%CE%9E%20Kh%C3%A1i%20ni%E1%BB%87m/Quy%20m%C3%B4.md)
We need a way to align these interests:
1. Humans who benefit from technology and are not required to become a product in the process
2. Investors who do not want to lose money
3. Foundations and individuals who want to see more responsible technology and technology that benefits their communities
4. Tech startups who have great ideas, teams, and a viable path to sustainability
5. Advisors and experts who want their expertise and knowledge to benefit humanity through the lens of tech

Philosophical considerations:
- This model is for builders who want to create high-impact companies and products and are more motivated by impact than wealth. The structure of the system should not “penalize” people for wealth-creation, it simply should align wealth-creation with ethics and overall system health.
- Everyone in the system should be motivated by one another’s success.
- The system must be protected from being gamed both by legal structures and human evaluation and trust.
- A goal is healthy, sustainable companies that are not founder-dependent or funding-dependent.
