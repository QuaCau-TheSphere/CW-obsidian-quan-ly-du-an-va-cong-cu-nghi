> What should stand out in the definition above are the expressions: _“grow this metric”_ and _“driving sustainable growth.”_ These two simple sentences make it crystal clear what the goal of the NSM should be. What’s less obvious and the part that companies always fail to spot is the “_core value that your product delivers to customers.”_ This is the purpose of the NSM! And yet, as I look around at product teams I’ve worked with, I cannot help but feel that somehow, somewhere we _lost our way, following the wrong star._
