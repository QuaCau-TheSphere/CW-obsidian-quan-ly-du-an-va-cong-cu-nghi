Khái niệm:: 
These machines differ from Commander Data in almost every conceivable way. They don't have the capacity to think through problems logically. They make up things that aren't true. They answer confidently even when they are wrong. They don't have Commander Data's capacity for ethical judgement.

And another key difference: think about any artificial intelligence from any science fiction world you like. 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, Wall-E — we have always imagined artificial intelligences as single sentient beings, rather than all-pervasive information systems that subtly infiltrate human efforts to make sense of world.
