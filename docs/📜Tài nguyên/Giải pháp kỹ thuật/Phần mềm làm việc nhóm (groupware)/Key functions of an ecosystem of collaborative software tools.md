## Key functions of an ecosystem of collaborative software tools

Here are a number of areas that we have decided are critical to this collaborative ecosystem

- **Notifications Dashboard:** aggregated notifications of activity that is sourced from activity from tools in the ecosystem
- **Chat and Direct Messaging:** one-to-one and one-to-many messaging, with tunable privacy as appropriate to communication goals
- **Representation of Group Membership and Group Auth:** a tool that stores who is a member of which group, who can see the data that the group contains, and can invoke single-purpose tools through “group authentication”
- **Representation of which groups are using which tools:** this enables the community to understand which tools are part of the set of tools in use in a given environment
- **Intent-casting + Collaborative discovery:** discovery of aligned intentions + matching of available requests and offers. Can include bounties/price tags in a variety of currencies.
- **Collaborative ideation & brainstorming:** allows decentralized groups to ideate and brainstorm together
- **Collaborative decision making:** allows decentralized groups to come to decisions together
- **Collaborative budgeting:** allows decentralized groups to allocate common-pool resources
- **Network visualization:** allows users to interact with different types of visual representations of shared data and membership
- **Reputation**: allows users to assess the past actions of network participants based on user tunable, context aware preferences
- **Identity**: allows users to be aware of the identity of other users over time tied to reputation
- **Mutual Credit:** allows users to create and track mutual credit exchanges
- **Task management:** allows users to assign and track completion of tasks
- **Dues collection:** allows users to pool resources
- **Common Resource Pool Management:** allows users to pool resources that can be invested collectively
- **Crowdfunding:** allows users to gather small contributions from large numbers of people
- **Cryptoequity:** allows users to share equity in each other’s projects and work with outside financing
- **Smart Contracts:** allows users to create contracts with each other that are machine-executable
- **Personal data management and export tools:** allow users to manage access to and export their private data

Might it be worth categorizing the toolset based on whether a tool is more infrastructure (e.g., cross-tool management, authentication, authorization) and more ‘silo’ delivery of a particular end-user capability? It seems that some of these tools could/should be deployed early in the process so that the more stand-alone tools can depend on them for base level capabilities. Perhaps this type of dependency is defined somewhere else…

I totally agree — The thought is, to have two general classes of tools:

1. Tools that are designed to hold complex group formation information/porosity that are able to invoke simpler single-use-case tools,

2. Tools that are designed to be invoked. (But tools can also stand alone with their own perception of group formation.)

If you have a complex/flexible group formation tool that can hold authentication and, and many complex use cases for group formation/composition, and be simple to use, that is a good way to “invoke” the tool you want to use with that hot-formed group.

So there are “group representation tools” like Hylo, Holodex, and Metamaps, for example, which can invoke tools like Loomio, Cobudget, or CredEx and handle auth when representing who can see/access an instance of one of these single-purpose tools.  
​  
And, the “group representation tools” can invoke each other, theoretically.
